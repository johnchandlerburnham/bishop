# Yatima: A programming language for the decentralized web

> In one sense, the Truth Mines were just another indexscape. Hundreds of

> Periodic Table, walked the avenue-like Timelines for the histories of
> fleshers, gleisners, and citizens. Half a megatau before, ve'd swum through
> the Eukaryotic Cell; every protein, every nucleotide, even carbohydrate
> drifting through the cytoplasm had broadcast gestalt tags with references to
> everything the library had to say about the molecule in question.
>
> In the Truth Mines, though, the tags weren't just references; they included
> complete statements of the particular definitions, axioms, or theorems the
> objects represented. The Mines were self-contained: every mathematical result
> that fleshers and their descendants had ever proven was on display in its
> entirety. The library's exegesis was helpful-but the truths themselves were
> all here.

Yatima is a functional programming language featuring several technologies:

- Native content-addressed IPLD global references, enabling p2p package
  management via IPFS (similar to *Unison*)
- First-class static types via quantitative type theory, enabling in-band formal
  verification (similar to *Idris*)
- A non-garbage-collected Web Assembly runtime with optimal sharing
- A performant EVM compiler
- Type-safe metaprogramming
