# Yatima: A dependently-typed functional programming language

Yatima is a language that combines several bleeding-edge functional programming
technologies:

1. Dependent or *first-class* static types,
2. Quantitive Type Theory
3. Content addressed code and P2P package management
4. Practical lambda encoded datatypes via self-types
5. Optimal beta reduction
